# Ridge-Regression
This is the jupiter notebook of the machine learning project submitted as term paper for 2019/2020, university of milan.
The project implements Ridge Regression from scratch without the use of popular python packages.
The aim is to predict housing prices using the California housing dataset on kaggle. I first implement ridge regression model with square loss, then evaluated the model using cross validation. PCA was applied to compare the performance with the ridge regression model
